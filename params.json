The actual mapping/warping of images (using the predicted momenta) is then realized using PyCA and VectorMomentum. Regaring minimum system requirements, we tested our code on Linux running Ubuntu 16.04 with 24GB of main memory and a NVIDIA Titan X (sponsored by NVIDIA, running CUDA 8.0). If the code runs on your system, please let us know your configuration and we are happy to add it to our list of supported platforms/configurations.\r\n\r\n* [Torch](http://torch.ch/)\r\n* [PyCA](https://bitbucket.org/scicompanat/pyca)\r\n* [Vector Momentum LDDMM](https://bitbucket.org/scicompanat/vectormomentum)\r\n* MATLAB (+ [Medical Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41594-medical-image-processing-toolbox))    \r\n\r\n### Compilation\r\n\r\nFirst, lets assume that all of our code will resides under `code`. First, we are going to install PyCA. Due to compatibility issues between the latest Vector Momentum LDDMM package (which we will use) and PyCA, we suggest to checkout a old(er) version of PyCA. Note, that we also need the Insight Toolkit (ITK) to be installed.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\napt-get install insighttoolkit4-python libinsighttoolkit4-dev # install ITK\r\ncd /code/\r\ngit clone git@bitbucket.org:scicompanat/pyca.git\r\ncd ./pyca\r\ngit checkout 9954dd5319efaa0ac5f58977e57acf004ad73ed7\r\nmkdir Build\r\ncd Build\r\nccmake .. # configure PyCA via cmake curses interface\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn our system, we had to bump the `CUDA_ARCH_VERSION` to 20 for PyCA to compile. This can be done via the ccmake interface in the Advanced Mode. Also, the Python bindings did not compile with SWIG 3.0.3; we downgraded to swig-2.0.12 instead\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install swig2.0\r\n# you might have to uninstall swig3.0 if errors persist\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, running\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /code/pyca/Build\r\nmake -j4 # -j4 will run 4 parallel jobs\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould compile PyCA. Finally, we also set the `PYTHONPATH` as follows (we do recommend to put this into the .bashrc file, assuming that you run bash):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:PATH_TO_PYCA/Build/python_module\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere you have to (1) replace `PATH_TO_PYCA` with the name of the directory where you checked out PyCA (we assume that you built PyCA under PATH_TO_PYCA/Build). Next, we are going to clone the VectorMomentum LDDMM code and set the `PYTHONPATH` as before:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /code/\r\ngit clone https://bitbucket.org/scicompanat/vectormomentum.git\r\nexport PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/code/vectormomentum/Code/Python\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nJust clone the GitHub repository as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /code/\r\ngit clone https://github.com/rkwitt/FastPredictiveImageRegistration.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### EXAMPLE 1: 2D atlas-to-image registration\r\n\r\n",
